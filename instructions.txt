Make sure you have CMake and Boost to run. Compile using below steps

1. make directory build - 'mkdir build'
2. cd to build - 'cd build'
3. cmake the project - 'cmake ..'
4. build the project - 'cmake --build .'
5. run the project with desired arguments e.g. - './server 5001 /usr/output.txt'
6. examples of singular client is given (warning: very messy) which provides two requests to a server.
